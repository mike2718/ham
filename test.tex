	This is a short example of a \LaTeX\ document I wrote on \today. It
	shows a few simple features of automated typesetting, including:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item setting the default font size to 12pt and specifying `article'
		type for formatting;
		\item using the Palatino typeface and some special formatting for
		URIs (web addresses);
		\item preventing sections being numbered;
		\item turning off justification for an informal document;
		\item formatting a section heading;
		\item using the \LaTeX\ logo;
		\item generating today's date;
		\item formatting this list of items;
		\item formatting a subsection heading;
		\item using opening and closing quotes;
		\item formatting a URI;
		\item arbitrary formatting: centering and italicisation;
		\item autonumbering the pages.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{More information}
	
	This example was taken from the book `Formatting Information',
	which you can read online or in PDF format at
	\url{http://latex.silmaril.ie/formattinginformation/} and use as a
	teach-yourself guide.
